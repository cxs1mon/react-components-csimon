# Text Genertor Component
The functionality of this project is intentionally simple, since the main focus is on deployment rather than features. \
What the Text Generator component does is: When the button is clicked, a random number is generated. This number is then compared to the current one, and if it is different, a new joke from the jokes array is loaded and displayed inside the paragraph. If the number is the same, a new one is generated again until it its different.
